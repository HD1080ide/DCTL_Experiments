# DRT for DaVinci Resolve YRGB Color Managed workflow using the chroma compression method by Mantiuk

Please keep in mind that:

* You also need the hellwig_lib.h file from [Nick Shaw's GitHub repo](https://github.com/nick-shaw/aces-ot-vwg-experiments/tree/master/dctl)
* The Timeline color space must be set to DaVinci WG/Intermediate
* The parameters k1 and k2 still need to be fine-tuned
* The DCTL is lacking out-of-gamut compression
